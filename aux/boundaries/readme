Here we provide a sample code to create a custom geometry.
The user can compile this code using:

	g++ sphere.cpp -lm -o sphere_creator

and execute the command:

	./sphere_creator 200 > sphere_200.csv

to create a boundary file containing a spherical geometry with 200 points in each dimension.
In order to use this boundary file in marlics the following lines need to be included in the input file:

	Geometry   Custom
	boundary_file sphere_200.csv
	
	nx         200
	ny         200
	nz         200
