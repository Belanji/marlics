Here we provide 2 sample code to create a custom geometry. Note that the sphere geometry works better with an odd number of points.

%%%%%%%%%% slab.cpp %%%%%%%%%%

The slab.cpp can be used to create a slab or an elipsoid to be used with the custom geometry.
The user can compile this code using:

	g++ slab.cpp -lm -o slab_creator

and execute the command:

	./slab_creator 100 > slab_100.csv

to create a boundary file containing a slab geometry with 100 points in each dimension, or with

	./slab_creator 100 100 200 > slab.csv

to create a boundary file containing a slab geometry with in a (100 x 100 x 200) lattice.
In order to use this boundary file in marlics the following lines need to be included in the input file:

	Geometry   Custom
	boundary_file slab.csv
	
	nx         100
	ny         100
	nz         200

In order to apply this slab, two boundaries, the bottom(0) and the top(1) surface, need to be defined in the input file.

%%%%%%%%%% sphere.cpp %%%%%%%%%%

The sphere.cpp can be used to create a sphere or an elipsoid to be used with the custom geometry.
The user can compile this code using:

	g++ sphere.cpp -lm -o sphere_creator

and execute the command:

	./sphere_creator 201 > sphere_201.csv

to create a boundary file containing a spherical geometry with 201 points in each dimension, or with:

	./sphere_creator 101 201 151 > elipsoid.csv

to create a boundary file containing an elipsoid of dimensions 101, 201 and 151 in the x, y and z direction respectvely.

In order to use the sphere_201.csv boundary file in marlics the following lines need to be included in the input file:

	Geometry   Custom
	boundary_file sphere_201.csv
	
	nx         201
	ny         201
	nz         201

In order to apply this sphere, a single boundary need to be defined in the input file.
