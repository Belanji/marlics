Here we provide 2 sample scripts created to vizualize a csv input_file.
The renderize.py can be used to represent the direct field as cilinders in 3 perpendicular planes.
The user can define a point (px,py,pz) to generate these planes with the command:

	pvbatch renderize.py 'input_file' [px py pz]
	
Or simple use the input_file midpoint using the command:
 	
	pvbatch renderize.py 'input_file'
	

s_iso.py will renderize a isosurface of the order parameter S evaluated on the bulk type points, using 90% of the maximum value as threshold, executing the command:

	pvbacth s_iso.py 'input_file' Nx Ny Nz

As side note, these scripts were created using the paraview 5.6.0 and can suffer from some compatibility issues with another version.
